Feng's Creative Lab — Template
==============================

This is a bilingual (Chinese/English) static website template to showcase:
- Blender learning log
- AI images & animations
- AI voice/audio samples
- Simple text games (HTML)

How to use:
1. Upload this folder (`feng_creative_lab_template`) to a GitHub repository.
2. Deploy with GitHub Pages by enabling Pages on the repository (branch: main, folder: /root).
3. Replace assets in /assets with your own images, animations (SVG/MP4), and audio (MP3/WAV).
4. Edit HTML files to add more logs, projects, and contact info.

Notes:
- The template references Tailwind CSS via CDN. Internet is required for styling to load.
- Audio sample file is a short generated WAV tone. Replace with your AI-generated MP3/OGG for real demos.

Enjoy — deploy and iterate!
